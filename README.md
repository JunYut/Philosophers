# **Multithreading**
## **1. Pthreads vs Standard Library**
The choice between using pthreads and the standard library for multithreading in C depends on your specific needs and constraints.

Here are a few factors to consider:

1. **Portability**: Pthreads is a POSIX standard, so it's available on most Unix-like systems, including Linux and macOS. However, it's not natively supported on Windows. The C11 threading library is part of the C standard, so in theory it should be more portable. However, support for threads in C11 is optional and not all compilers or platforms support it.

2. **Functionality**: Pthreads has been around for a long time and it's very feature-rich. It supports a wide range of threading and synchronization primitives. The C11 threading library is newer and not as feature-rich, but it does provide the basic functionality needed for multithreading.

3. **Ease of use**: The C11 threading library has a simpler and more modern API, which some developers might find easier to use. Pthreads is older and its API is a bit more complex, but it's also very flexible and powerful.

In general, if you're writing code that needs to be portable across a wide range of systems and compilers, and you only need basic threading functionality, then the C11 threading library might be a good choice. If you need more advanced features, or if you're working on a Unix-like system and don't need to port your code to other platforms, then pthreads might be a better choice.
